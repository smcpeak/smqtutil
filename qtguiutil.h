// qtguiutil.h
// Qt utilities that require Qt5Gui or Qt5Widgets as opposed to Qt5Core.

// I have split this off from 'qtutil.h' so I can have programs that
// only link with Qt5Core.  This gets included in libsmqtutil.a, but
// the linker will only pull it in to an executable if one of its
// symbols is used.
