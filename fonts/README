fonts/README

Origins of the fonts here:

* cour[BOR]24_ISO8859_1.bdf

  These were obtained by copying cygwin
  /usr/share/X11/fonts/75dpi/cour[BOR]24-ISO8859-1.pcf.gz,
  decompressing, and applying pcf2bdf on Linux.

* minihex6.bdf

  My own creation.  mini-hex-font.xcf is its Gimp source.

* editor14[bir].bdf

  I don't recall exactly, but I think they came from a 14-pixel 75 DPI
  courier font from X11 on some Linux distro.  I then edited a few of
  the glyphs manually using xmbdfed.

* lurs12.bdf

  I don't remember at all.  Probably X11 again.
